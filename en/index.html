				At Bart college, every student had a project to do in order to emulate
			  a complete videogame production. We had 2 semesters (about 25 weeks) to
			  complete the game. My project, Aerodynamic, is a platformer based on
			  physics which requires a great amount of precision. The player can move
			  his arms with the mouse and his legs with WASD. This project was my first
			  experience in a full production.

              This project was made during my studies in computer technology at 
              Cégep de Sherbrooke. As a team of 4, we had to deliver a piece of
              software to an actual company. One of my team members was already
              employed at the Séminaire de Sherbrooke, and they needed a system to
              manage their students activities on friday afternoons. Our software,
              made in PHP (Laravel), made it easy for them to manage schedules, and
              for parents to locate carpoolers and chat with them from a website.

              In 2021, I contributed to the numerous updates of Quinco & Co's new
              WallStories app. Customers could buy WallStories stickers at different
              locations, and stick it to a wall in their house. Then, they could
              download the app and activate the sticker with an activation code. The
              sticker would then animate using Vuforia, an AR technology. I contributed
              to the app's content updates during 2021.
